# Credit Card Churn analysis

The following is the problem affecting a banking institution:

A banking institution realized that its customers are continously ending their credit card services. Meetings were arranged to figure out why that was happening but no one knew why. So, in order to figure out the root of problem, Data Science can be used to analyze the situation, spot the factors that are making the customers end their services and propose a solution. Also, it would be benefitial to the bank if it could predict which customers were potential churns, so they could contact the customer and offer them better services in order to influence them to keep using their credit card services.

## Tools
In this analysis I'll be using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy and Plotly.
